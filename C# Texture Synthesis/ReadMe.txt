The Texture synthesis program is inspired by a paper down by Wei-Levoy that highlights
the uses of procedurally generated textures. My understanding of the math done through their paper
to generate the textures may be off as there seems to be more fragments of bad texturing found inspired
the example folder but what I currently have here does highlight that the formula, or at least my 
understanding of it, works and can synthesize procedural textures from a base image.
