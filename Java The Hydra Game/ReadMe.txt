The Hydra project was made for one of my classes and shows how long it would take to kill a hydra assuming that its head would
be replanted for the previous node in the tree. heads can be picked at random and the amount of heads regrown can be set by the user.
it also allows for games to be saved via text files for importing and exporting games/ saves.
